Budget vs Rating is better. 
How well a movie is rated doesnâ€™t depend on the budget while ratings goes together with WinsNoms. There are many poorly rated movies with 0 or low WinsNoms, while the budget for these movies are well spread.
Similar ratings will yield similar WinsNoms but not similar budget.

If the range of data is very large, spread across several orders of magnitude i.e from 10 - 1,000,000 then a log scale would work well.
If the y variable increases exponentially then a SQRT scale would work well i.e when y = 2^x or something like that.
